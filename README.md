## FAQ

**_macOS won't let me open the app, what should I do?_**

Instead of double clicking it, right click and choose "Open". That should successfully
open Ajour.

**_What requirements does Ajour have?_**

Windows: DX12 or Vulkan
Linux: Vulkan
macOS: Metal

If you are having problems with these requirements, then try the OpenGL build.

**_Where does Ajour store its configuration?_**

Ajour will generate a folder in the following directory:

macOS / Linux:

- `$HOME/.config/ajour`

Windows:

- `%APPDATA%\ajour`

Inside this folder Ajour will keep a configuration file for storing different user
settings, a log file with events from the last session, a fingerprint file with
hashed fingerprints for each addon and a theme folder with custom themes.

**_Why Rust?_**

We wanted to create an application which natively compiles to both Windows, Linux
and macOS while at the same time is as performant and reliable as possible.
