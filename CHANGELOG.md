## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2020-10-06
### Added
- The catalog has been implemented ðŸ“¦
  - This is long awaited, but we wanted to get it right. You can now easily and quickly search, filter and install addons
  - This first release of the catalog will come with CurseForge as source and in the next release we will add Tukui as well
- Logic for falling back to root World of Warcraft directory if a sub-folder was chosen
  - We solved a UX problem with some coding logic. It was not always clear that Ajour requires the World of Warcraft root folder

### Changed
- Tidy up Settings
- Better onboarding the first time you start Ajour
  - We have added a nice button to the welcome message to let users easily get going by selecting the World of Warcraft path

## [0.3.5] - 2020-10-01
### Packaging
- Updated Ajour icon.
- Added an alternative build that uses OpenGL. This will allow Ajour to be used by the widest possible audience, and resolve issues where users couldn't use Ajour with older / certain GPU configurations. An alternative download link will be provided to users wanting to try this build over the default.
- Added AppImage release that can be used on linux distro

### Added

- You can now select which release channel you want each addon to use. Currently `alpha`, `beta` and `stable` is supported.
- Columns can now be toggled as visible and reordered from settings. In addition, 3 new optional columns have been added that can be toggled (Channel, Game Version, Author).
- Added command line options that can be specified to change the behavior of Ajour at runtime.
  - `--data <PATH>` can be specified to use a custom data directory
  - `--aa <true / false>` can be specified to enable / disable Anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing is used by default if not specified.

### Changed

- Ignored addons has been removed from settings, and is now present in the addon list with a `ignored` status.
  - Reason for this is to clean up settings view. 
- Reworked the controls for selected flavor. It should now be more obvious what is selected and what you can select.
- Ajour now does a better job at cache busting by looking at the modified date on a Addon folder.

### Fixed

- Ajour now creates the `.config` dir if it does not exist on macOS and Linux.
  - This fixes a crash where Ajour coudn't start if the user didn't have a `.config` directory.
- Fixed a issue where Ajour would crash if CurseForge returned Minecraft addons instead of a World of Warcraft addons.
  - We have had a incident where a requested World of Warcraft addon was returned as a Minecraft plugin called HorsePower. This we did not expect so Ajour would crash. 

## [0.3.4] - 2020-09-26
### Packaging

- Windows: Ajour now comes bundled with the needed dependencies. This way we avoid relying on the system having Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable.

### Added

- It is now possible to see when a update was released in the details view of an addon. 
- A website button has been added to the detail view of each addon.
  - The idea is that with this button, it is easy to open up the addon website and view additional information which Ajour might not show.
- Columns can be resized by clicking & dragging the dividers between the column headers. This change will be saved and used when starting Ajour.
- Window size will be saved when resizing the application and used when starting Ajour.
- UI Scaling has been added to settings. UI scale can be increased or decreased and will be saved when changed.
- A backup option has been added to archive the AddOns and WTF folders from each flavor installed on the machine to a user chosen directory.
  - Backups created through Ajour are not actively managed once created, so pruning old backups and restoring from a backup need to be handled by the user

### Changed

- Detail view has now a more calm look by utlilizing the space to the right, and by increasing the opacity of the background slighty to create some levels in the design.

## [0.3.3] - 2020-09-17

### Packaging

- Added local logging for debugging the application. An `ajour.log` file is saved in the ajour config directory. This file can be shared along with any bug reports to help better debug the issue

### Added

- Improve clarity of row titles to reflect current sort state

### Changed

- Made it easier to use Ajour if you play both Classic and Retail by moving the control from settings into the menubar
  - Ajour will now parse both Classic and Retail directories on launch. This means that when you switch between the two it will now be instantaneously

### Fixed

- Update all will now respect ignored addons, and correctly skip them
- The settings- and detail-window will now be closed on interactions outside of it
  - It was a bit confusing that the windows stayed open even though you interacted with the application outside of them
- When displaying details for an addon, the title of the addon is highlighted to improve visibility of which addon is expanded
- Better toc file parsing
  - We now have better logic catching the values inside the toc file
  - If we for some reason does not find a title for the addon, we fallback and use the foldername
- Check for case-insensitive version of `Interface/AddOns` folder for robustness
- Check for & create ajour config folder before launching concurrent init operations
  - The `load_config` and `load_user_themes` operations are launched concurrently on startup. Since they both require the config folder, they will both try to create it if it doesn't exist. This causes a panic on linux since the `create_dir` fs operation fails if the folder already exists

## [0.3.2] - 2020-09-11

### Changed

- Light theme is now a bit more gentle to the eyes. Don't worry, it's still not default.
- Switched Refresh and Update All buttons.

## [0.3.1] - 2020-09-11

### Fixed

- Correctly rehashes addon after an update.
  - After an addon was updated we did in some cases not rehash correctly. This was due to the fact that a addon can have multiple folders and this was not taken into account in this case. Another case was that we replaced the content with the new update, but that could again lead to a miscalclulated hash if there was a mismatch in amount of files. Thanks to [tarkah](https://github.com/tarkah) for these optimizations.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-09-10

### Added

- Fingerprinting is now used to better match addons.
  - This is a bigger refactor, which introduces a whole new way of matching addons. We are now doing a hash of each addon, which we then compare with the API to see if we need to update or not. It has, however, introduced a longer initial load time because we need to hash each addon. The hash is saved locally, so we have some logic in place to minimize the amount of times we are hashing.

### Fixed

- Trimming leading and trailing whitespace from toc values.
  - Small issue where some `.toc` files added multiple space before, or after values which would confuse our UI.
- UI glitch in settings has been removed.
